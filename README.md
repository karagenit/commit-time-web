# commit-time-web
Web Dashboard for commit-time

## Roadmap

- [x] Basic Query Display using commit-time-github
- [ ] Improve styling
- [ ] User/Repo Caching (manual buttons for list & each repo)
- [ ] Background jobs with AJAX Status
- [ ] Auto timestamp-based cache update - if new commits, fetch them
- [ ] Cache all commit timestamps instead of just total times - reduces cache update work (just grab the new commits)

#### Visualizations

- [ ] total time
- [ ] total time for each project (top 20 or so)
- [ ] Time spent over time (both for total and per project) (on a monthly/yearly scale as line graph)
- [ ] maybe some language breakdowns etc
