# commit-time-web
Web Dashboard for commit-time

Second version will be a web app using github's v4 API to display a dashboard, with sections like

- total time (and total time by month/year/etc in line graph)
- total time for each project (and total time by month/year/etc in line graph)
- maybe some language breakdowns etc

Since it requires fairly heavy api usage, we might eventually make the calculations done on a job and display data via ajax.
